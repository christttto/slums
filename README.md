### Context  
My logic behind was that because the user of the application will have hard time reading the exam, they are more likely to be handed a tablet to them to take the exam without instructor.  
Therefore, this iteration of problem flow allowed me to get to think about the conversion, moving the test into a modern portable device.  
Some questions are less obvious as how they should be presented. The big issue is, SLUMS exam has been very carefully crafted by medical professionals to draw guideline for the exam-takers. Therefore, difficulty cannot be jeopardized, modified, or adjusted.  
Therefore, the process required several iterations to make the problem flow as close to the original test, while enabling the user can take the exam alone.
